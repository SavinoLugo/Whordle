  <h1>History</h1>
      <p> The original wordle was created in october of 2021 by Josh Wardle. By the start of January of 2022 it had over 300K players. On the 31st of January The New York Times announced they were buying it for a "lower seven figure" price.</p>
      <h2>Game Play</h2>
      <h3>In my version of wordle the player will still have six tries to guess a five letter word, but when you guess a word the only hint you will recive is when a correct letters box turns green. There aren't any yellow hints in this version so be catious.</h3>
