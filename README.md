## Description:

A web browser word guessing game based off of The NYTime's game "_Wordle_".
In this game you have six tries to guess the corret word.
In the original version of the game you would get two hints, one is that a correct letter in the correct space turns green. The second is that a correct letter in the wrong space turns yellow.
Each day there is only one wordle.
The words are only five letters long.

My version of the game is different
The only hints are that correct letters turn green.
You can do as many wordles as you want by hitting the play again button.
